# Interval Problems

An interval is a range of values between two endpoints. In computer science, intervals are often used to represent a set of numbers or a range of values.

Intervals can be represented in different ways, depending on their type and how they are defined. Here are some common representations:

* **Closed interval**: A closed interval includes both endpoints. For example, [1, 5] represents the set of numbers {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}.
* **Open interval**: An open interval excludes both endpoints. For example, (1, 5) represents the set of numbers {2, 3, 4}.
* **Half-open interval**: A half-open interval includes one endpoint but excludes the other. For example, [1, 5) represents the set of numbers {1, 2, 3, 4}.
* **Infinite interval**: An infinite interval extends to infinity in one or both directions. For example, (-∞, 5) represents the set of numbers less than or equal to 5, and (2, ∞) represents the set of numbers greater than 2.

Intervals can be combined using set operations such as union, intersection, and difference. For example, the union of [1, 3] and [2, 5] is [1, 5], the intersection is [2, 3], and the difference is [1, 2) U (3, 5].

In interval problems, we often need to 
* find the overlap or intersection between two intervals, 
* determine whether an interval is contained within another interval,
* find the smallest set of intervals that covers a given set of points.

## Finding Overlaps
To find the overlap between two intervals, we need to check if they intersect. If they do intersect, we need to find the common part or the overlap.

Here are the steps to find the overlap between two intervals:

1. Check if the two intervals intersect: To check if two intervals intersect, we need to compare the endpoints of the intervals. If the endpoint of one interval is greater than or equal to the start point of the other interval, and the endpoint of the other interval is greater than or equal to the start point of the first interval, then the intervals intersect.

2. Find the overlap: Once we have established that the intervals intersect, we need to find the common part or the overlap. To do this, we can take the maximum of the start points of the two intervals as the start point of the overlap, and the minimum of the end points of the two intervals as the end point of the overlap.

Here's some sample Go code that implements the above steps:

```go
type Interval struct {
    start int
    end   int
}

func findOverlap(interval1 Interval, interval2 Interval) Interval {
    var overlap Interval

    // check if the intervals intersect
    if interval1.start <= interval2.end && interval2.start <= interval1.end {
        // find the overlap
        overlap.start = max(interval1.start, interval2.start)
        overlap.end = min(interval1.end, interval2.end)
    }

    return overlap
}

func max(a int, b int) int {
    if a > b {
        return a
    }
    return b
}

func min(a int, b int) int {
    if a < b {
        return a
    }
    return b
}
```

In the above code, the `findOverlap` function takes two intervals as input and returns the overlap interval if they intersect. 

## To find if interval is contained within another interval
To determine whether an interval is contained within another interval, we need to check if the first interval is completely contained within the second interval.

Here are the steps to determine whether an interval is contained within another interval:

1. Check if the start point of the first interval is greater than or equal to the start point of the second interval.
2. Check if the end point of the first interval is less than or equal to the end point of the second interval.

If both conditions are true, then the first interval is completely contained within the second interval.

Here's some sample Go code that implements the above steps:

```go
type Interval struct {
    start int
    end   int
}

func isIntervalContained(interval1 Interval, interval2 Interval) bool {
    // check if the first interval is completely contained within the second interval
    if interval1.start >= interval2.start && interval1.end <= interval2.end {
        return true
    }

    return false
}
```

In the above code, the `isIntervalContained` function takes two intervals as input and returns `true` if the first interval is completely contained within the second interval. Otherwise, it returns `false`.

## Interval covering a point

When we say that an interval covers a point, it means that the point lies within the interval. In other words, 
if we have an interval [a, b], and a point x, then we say that the interval covers the point if a <= x <= b.

For example, if we have the interval [2, 5], then this interval covers the point 3, since 2 <= 3 <= 5. 
However, this interval does not cover the point 7, since 7 is not within the interval.

When we are dealing with a set of points, we want to find the smallest set of intervals 
that covers all the points. This means that each point in the set must be covered by at 
least one interval in the set, and no interval in the set should cover any unnecessary points 
outside the original set.

Examples of intervals that cover a given set of points:

1. The set of points {1, 3, 5, 7, 9} can be covered by the intervals {[1,1], [3,3], [5,5], [7,7], [9,9]}.
2. The set of points {2, 4, 6, 8, 10} can be covered by the intervals {[2,2], [4,4], [6,6], [8,8], [10,10]}.
3. The set of points {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} can be covered by the interval [1,5].
4. The set of points {1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9} can be covered by the intervals {[1,1], [3,4], [6,7], [9,9]}.
5. The set of points {2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9} can be covered by the intervals {[2,2], [4,7], [9,9]}.

In general, there can be multiple ways to cover a given set of points with intervals, 
but the goal is to find the smallest set of intervals that covers all the points. 

To find the smallest set of intervals that covers a given set of points, we can use the greedy algorithm approach. Here are the steps:

1. Sort the set of points in ascending order.
2. Initialize an empty list to store the intervals.
3. Loop through the sorted points from left to right:
   a. If the current point is not covered by any existing interval, create a new interval that covers this point.
   b. If the current point is already covered by an existing interval, skip to the next point.
4. Return the list of intervals.

Here's some sample Go code that implements the above steps:

```go
type Interval struct {
    start int
    end   int
}

func findIntervals(points []int) []Interval {
    // Sort the points in ascending order.
    sort.Ints(points)

    // Initialize an empty list of intervals.
    intervals := []Interval{}

    // Loop through the sorted points and create intervals as needed.
    for i := 0; i < len(points); i++ {
        if len(intervals) == 0 || points[i] > intervals[len(intervals)-1].end {
            // Create a new interval that covers the current point.
            intervals = append(intervals, Interval{points[i], points[i]})
        } else {
            // Extend the last interval to cover the current point.
            intervals[len(intervals)-1].end = points[i]
        }
    }

    return intervals
}


func main() {
    // create a slice of points
    points := []int{1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9}
    
    // find the smallest set of intervals that cover the points
    intervals := findIntervals(points)
    
    // print the intervals
    fmt.Println(intervals)
}
```

In the above code, the `findIntervals` function takes a slice of points as input and 
returns a slice of intervals that cover all the points. The function first sorts the 
points in ascending order, and then loops through them to create intervals as needed. 
If the current point is not covered by any existing interval, the function creates a 
new interval that covers this point. If the current point is already covered by an 
existing interval, the function extends the last interval to cover the current point.

**Input**: [[1,3], [4,6], [7,9]], 
**Output**: False

**Explanation**: There is no overlap between any two intervals in the set `[[1,3], [4,6], [7,9]]`, so the output is False.
